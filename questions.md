**A2**: 

You are able to focus directly on just the issues that are relevant to the problem for making a quick issue.

**A3**: 

1.Waterfall model<br>
```
Advantages
  - It's useful when requirement are clear.
  - It's easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model, each phase has specific deliverables and a review process.

Disadvantages
  - Not a good model for complex and object-oriented projects.
  - Not a good when requirements are ambiguous, and doesn’t support frequent interaction with the customers for feedback and proposing changes.
  - Poor model for long and ongoing projects.
  - No working software is produced until late during the life cycle.
```
2.Spiral model<br>
```
Advantages 
  - It’s good for high risky or large projects where the requirements are ambiguous.
  - Strong approval and documentation control.
  - Software is produced early in the software life cycle.
  - Additional Functionality can be added at a later date.
  - Good for large and mission-critical projects.

Disadvantages
  - May be hard to define objective, verifiable milestones.
  - Doesn’t work well for smaller projects.
  - Risk analysis requires highly specific expertise.
  - It's not suitable for low risk projects.
```
3.Agile<br>
```
Advantages
  - Customer satisfaction by rapid, continuous delivery of useful software.
  - Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication.
  - Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers.
  - Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.
  - Even late changes in requirements are welcomed.

Disadvantages
  - There is lack of emphasis on necessary designing and documentation.
  - The project can easily get taken off track if the customer representative is not clear what final outcome that they want.
  - In case of some software deliverables, especially the large ones, it is difficult to assess the effort required at the beginning of the software development life cycle.
